# striver-a2z-sheet

For my introduction my name is Arijit Biswas, final year CSE student @NIT Durgapur and upcoming ASDE in Publicis Sapient. 

1. So, why I'm doing A2Z sheet?
-> After placements there is a gradual decline in my problem solving because I moreover focus on my Development skills so for brush up my problwm solving I start the a2z sheet.

2. Why I'm starting A2Z sheet and not SDE sheet?
-> In my placements time I solved each and every problem of SDE sheet and I can definitely assure you SDE sheet is one of the best sheet available in the market. That's    why I'm starting with A2Z sheet because the number of problems are greater than SDE sheet.

3. Why I'm sharing this?
-> Because many of you after listening to youtube celebrities that DSA is not important but that might be true for SDE 2 or SDE 3. If you want to join any comapny at SDE    1 level (Except few) then good problem solving ability is a must have skill :)
