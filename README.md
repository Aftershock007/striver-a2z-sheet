# striver-a2z-sheet

For my introduction, my name is Arijit Biswas, CSE student @NIT Durgapur'23 and upcoming ASDE in Publicis Sapient.

1. Why I'm doing the A2Z sheet?

   After placements, there is a gradual decline in my problem-solving because I moreover focus on my Development skills so to brush up on my problem solving I start the a2z sheet.

2. Why I'm starting the A2Z sheet and not the SDE sheet?

   During my placements time, I solved each and every problem with the SDE sheet and I can definitely assure you SDE sheet is one of the best sheets available in the market. That's why I'm starting with the A2Z sheet because the number of problems is greater than the SDE sheet.

3. Why I'm sharing this?

   Because many of you after listening to youtube celebrities that DSA is not important but that might be true for SDE 2 or SDE 3. If you want to join any company at SDE 1 level (Except a few) then a good problem-solving ability is a must-have skill :)
